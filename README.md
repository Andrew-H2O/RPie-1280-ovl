# Overlays for Retropie 4.x - Retroarch/Libretro 
Arcade game overlays created for Lr-Mame2003 (latest version with correct aspect ratio) and 1280x1024 Display.

Original logos, artwork, graphics and trademarks are property of their respective owners. 

## How to install (recommended)

Using meleu's [`rpie-art.sh` script](https://github.com/meleu/rpie-art):

```
cd
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/meleu/rpie-art
cd rpie-art
./rpie-art.sh
```

After launching `rpie-art.sh` you just have to follow the instructions in the dialog boxes.


## How to install manually

Each overlay folder contains specific instruction; generally setup OVERLAY in this way:

The `.cfg` files assume retroarch overlay folder is: `/opt/retropie/emulators/retroarch/overlays/arcade-bezels/`

If using a different folder, edit `.cfg` files accordingly.

If folder does not exist on your RetroPie, create `arcade-bezels` folder with the mentioned path.

Summarizing the steps:
- ssh or ftp into Pi
- copy romname.zip.cfg into your `mame-libretro` (lr-mame2003) ROMS folder
- copy png file and `romname.cfg` into overlay folder

## Launching Images
Game specific launching images are named `RomName-lanching.png` (or `.jpg`).
To install copy the image to the `RetroPie/roms/[SYSTEM]/images/` folder on your RetroPie and, if needed, rename the file to match the exact name of the ROM plus the trailing `-launching.png` (or `.jpg`).

Have fun !
